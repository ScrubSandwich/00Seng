# 00Seng

A James Bond spin-off game written in Python using PyGame for Operation Catapult 97 at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. The object of the game is score as many points as possible in the allotted time by slaying as many enemies as you can.  Enemies come at you, 00Seng, from right and left. You must be quick to fend them off with your pistol. You will need to hold back your itchy trigger finger, however, as you only have 10 shots. If you run out of shots, you can switch to your sword for melee attacks.

All graphics were hand drawn in Microsoft Paint and Paint.net. Picutres of Ka Seng Lim (00Seng) and my sister (Enemies) used with permission.
